    * DecimalVersion should have properties a, b, c, d replacing
        getA(), getB(), etc

2015-11-23
    * by default, print version numbers in three parts, so that
        for example 1 becomes 1.0.0 and 1.2 is printed as 1.2.0
    * so continue to parse eg 1 and 1.0 and 1.0.0 identically, but
        always convert to string as 1.0.0

    * urgently need API docs

    * move __SPACES__ and getSpaces from nlhTree to xlattice.crypto     * DONE
        to avoid import loops                                           * DONE

    * write test of nextNBLine()
    * write test of collectPEMRSAPublicKey()                            * DONE
    * write collectPEMRSAPrivateKey()
        - and test

    * needs some documentation, however skimpy

2015-05-22
    * make testRSA.py less talkative                                    * DONE

    * mkdir_p needs testing
2015-05-17
    * git push appears to have failed, but with no meaningful error     * FIXED
        message.  xlattice_py on github has myData/ myU1/ myU2/         * FIXED
        trash, which it shouldn't.  URGENT need to reconcile what       * FIXED
        we have here and what is on github                              * FIXED

    * myData/ myU1/ myU2 need to be added to .gitignore,
        which requires a .gitignore-local functionality
    * move SHA1* constants to xlattice package                          * DONE
    * need test for xlattice.ui (passwdStrength)

        - FAILED because sharedev subdir had not been deleted           * OK...
        - manually fixed but still see 'dummy index' on github.io       * OK...
        - touched *.html in sharedev and then git commit from           * OK...
            sharedev; this worked                                       * OK...

FROM ~/dev/py/u/TODO ================================================

2015-03-19
    * if eg myU2/tmp does not exist, the library must create it         * DONE

2012-07-28 
    * FIX: testU256x256.py fails (because testU/tmp does not exist?)    * DONE

2012-07-02
    * added u.getData(uPath, key); needs to be tested

2012-06-02
    * BUG found when attempting to run upaxUpdateNodeID on test:
        copyAndPut invokes put which attempts to rename a temporary 
        file into /var/Upax; this yields an 'invalid cross-device link' 
        error 
        -- FIXED?

    * BUG observed but hasn't caused an error yet: u.put expects input
        file to be in the same file system.

    * lock directory /tmp/u must be world-writeable; the current 
        implementation creates world-writeable leaf directories but 
        intermediate directories may not be such

2012-05-30
    * consider adding keyless copyAndPut(), put(), and putData(); these 
        would have names like putKeyless(), would have no content key
        parameter, but would still return the content key

    * Compare code from xlshadow
