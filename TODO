    * myData/ myU1/ myU2 need to be added to .gitignore,
        which requires a .gitignore-local functionality

    * if eg myU2/tmp does not exist, the library must create it

2012-07-28 
    * FIX: testU256x256.py fails (because testU/tmp does not exist?)

2012-07-02
    * added u.getData(uPath, key); needs to be tested

2012-06-02
    * BUG found when attempting to run upaxUpdateNodeID on test:
        copyAndPut invokes put which attempts to rename a temporary 
        file into /var/Upax; this yields an 'invalid cross-device link' 
        error 
        -- FIXED?

    * BUG observed but hasn't caused an error yet: u.put expects input
        file to be in the same file system.

    * lock directory /tmp/u must be world-writeable; the current 
        implementation creates world-writeable leaf directories but 
        intermediate directories may not be such

2012-05-30
    * consider adding keyless copyAndPut(), put(), and putData(); these 
        would have names like putKeyless(), would have no content key
        parameter, but would still return the content key

    * Compare code from xlshadow
